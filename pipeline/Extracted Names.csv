0,IBRO_Rep/PMC6084867.nxml,"<ack id=""ack0010""><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>First, we would like to acknowledge and thank Matt Ferola and Carlos Maya for their diligent and compassionate care of the animals involved in these studies. They provide a clean and safe environment for the mice which contributes to an atmosphere that respects the contributions of the animals and produces the most interpretable results. Next, we would like to thank all of our many supporters who provided funding for these not-for-profit studies. Many of the supporters are people living with ALS, their caretakers, immediate and extended family members, and their friends. Without their generous support these studies would not have been possible. Specifically, we would like to thank Augie's Quest and Corey's Crusade for inspiring and funding these studies.</p></ack>",Matt Ferola;Carlos Maya

These models deal with the long- and short-time changes in size and composition of biological populations, as well as the biological and environmental factors affecting these changes.</p><p><bold>Stoichiometric models</bold>. These describe the set of metabolites taking part in cellular metabolism and their reactions based on chemical stoichiometry at steady state. The framework allows graph theoretical investigation of the cellular metabolism and linear optimisation of cellular fluxes. The latter approach includes FBA that optimises to predefined constraints such as biomass yield for given uptake rates and dynamic FBA, which adds a dynamical framework.</p><p><bold>Individual-based models</bold>. These represent individual organisms (here microbes) as ‘agents', whose behaviour depends on a predefined set of rules. The global dynamics of the system are a consequence of the interplay between the local interactions of all agents in the system.</p><p><bold>Causal and correlational networks</bold>. Networks (graphs) are general tools for representation and analysis of systems with a distinct interaction structure. Nodes represent the constituents of the system, edges between them their interactions that can be based on causal evidence or on statistical inference. Studies on network topology and dynamics can predict community properties and behaviour.</p><p><bold>Kinetic growth models</bold>. These models seek to describe the growth rate of a microbial population as a function of the concentrations of one or more chemicals (nutrients/inhibitors). To represent MCs, several coupled equations are used, each describing a different population within the community. An example of a kinetic growth model is the classical Monod model.</p><p><bold>Well-mixed and spatially resolved approaches</bold>. In ‘well-mixed models', for example, ODEs, the spatial positions of the model constituents are not resolved; they are assumed to be homogenously distributed in space. If spatial structure is important for the dynamics of a system, for example, if its behaviour is controlled by motility or by chemical diffusion processes, then ‘spatially resolved' approaches such as continuum spatial models or spatially resolved individual-based models should be considered. These models represent space explicitly.</p><p><bold>Evolutionary game theory</bold>. Game theory considers strategic decision making in a group of competitors, resulting in conflict and cooperation. The application of game theory to evolving biological populations is called evolutionary game theory. Questions focus on evolving strategies (change of strategies and its frequency), such as the rock–paper–scissors dynamics in bacteriocin-producing MCs (Figure 4).</p></ack>","Isaac Newton;Aglika Gungova;Stela Ilieva;Isaac Newton;James Chong30;Marco Cosentino Lagomarsino31;Ottavio A Croze32;Jérôme Hamelin33;Jérôme Harmand33;Rebecca Hoyle34;Terence T Hwa35;Qusheng Jin36;David R Johnson37;Víctor de Lorenzo38;Mauro Mobilia39;Barry Murphy40;François Peaudecerf41;James I Prosser42;Robert A Quinn14;Markus Ralser43,44;Alison G Smith45;Philippe Steyer33;Neil Swainston46;Corina E Tarnita47;Eric Trably33;Patrick B Warren40;Paul Wilmes4829Department;Marie Curie"
