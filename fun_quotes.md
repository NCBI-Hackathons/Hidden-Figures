"Detailed analyses of data relevant to cancer were extended at National Cancer Institute (NCI), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), despite initial heavy oppositions, minimizations, denials and rejections of submitted proposals for promoting the important role of inflammation-immunity in cancer research, prevention and therapy, by politicians/scientists in decision making roles at NCI/NIH since 1998.
    
The author has retired from the NCI/NIH."

Many thanks to the following for their advice, comments, and encouragement during the preparation of this rant… erm, article: Jon Bakker, Judith Drexler, Greg Corace, Kurt Reinhart, and David Schneider. Special thanks to Colin Legg, our former PhD supervisor, who first got us wrestling with these issues, just one of the many ways in which we're indebted to him. Our gratitude also to all those who took the time to complete and publicize the questionnaire. Finally, Matt would like to say to the folk who, about 5 years ago, wrote a paper on the effects of a wildfire and grazing on an exclosure of _Betula nana_; he was wrong to have rejected your paper (but you should have had more cautious hypotheses and interpretations!). We know that the concept of pseudoreplication is limiting the publication of interesting ecology because, in the past, we were guilty of being overzealous with it too. Sorry."

"This article had previously been submitted to multiple peer-reviewed scientific journals and subsequently rejected without review, or vehemently rejected without apparent justification other than to say that it challenged the ‘status-quo’ of these beliefs. We stress the importance of open-minded thinking by challenging current hypotheses which, in turn, results in a search for the truth rather than blind attachment to current doctrine."
