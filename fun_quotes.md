>This article had previously been submitted to multiple peer-reviewed scientific journals and subsequently rejected without review, or **vehemently rejected** without apparent justification other than to say that it challenged the ‘status-quo’ of these beliefs. We stress the importance of open-minded thinking by challenging current hypotheses which, in turn, results in a search for the truth rather than blind attachment to current doctrine."
